# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This Neovim configuration was created using the starter template from
https://github.com/LazyVim/lazyvim

See https://www.lazyvim.org/ for documentation on customizing LazyVim.

The default LazyVim configuration has been modified to integrate into
the multi-config setup found here. To enable LazyVim as the selected
Neovim configuration, set `M.config = "LazyVim"` in `../configuration.lua`.
